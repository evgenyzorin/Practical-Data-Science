__label__-1 "i agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me . if you do n't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially then it might be for you . i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up ."
__label__-1 "i pretty much am in agreement with the first original reviewer on here . big disappointment especially if you have hips and are busty . _____________ pros : - great breathable fabric . - cute look overall . - sash in front brings it all together . - buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric which is a nice touch . ____________ cons : - runs very small in the bust . normally i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer 's stuff . i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i"
__label__0 "this runs a little big and falls off the shoulders a bit . i did n't like it as much as i had hoped ."
__label__0 "after reading all the reviews i ordered up a size . the problem is n't that it runs small . it 's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size . or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size . the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect . unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws ( spare tire ) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso"
__label__1 "i saw this top online and loved it . i was n't sure about sizing and because i do n't live near a store i decided to order two sizes . i 'm 5 ' 8 and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops . the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders . i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully !"
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store . i 'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest . i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight . i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom . overall design and material were good but the sizing was off ."
__label__-1 "these have a very interesting cut . it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall . i 'm about 5 ' 5 and the size 4 fit in the waist but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture . it 's hard to imagine who they would look good on they 're also very poofy right below the waist ."
__label__-1 "loved how this top looked online and could n't wait to get it . i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online . i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off . this is going back !"
__label__-1 "i was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted they were short . very weird look for a wrap . returned ."
__label__1 "i just received this top in the mail and i could n't be happier with how it fits and feels on . might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front . it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine . i am 5 ' 6 and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model . i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them ."
__label__0 "the top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature . however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me . the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering . i have a medium on in the photo my measurements are 38-30-40 ."

__label__0 "this dress is stunning . it is a great classic that i wished had worked out for me . i went through 3 different dresses and each time the cap sleeve would tear . there is not much room if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing . i am so disappointed . it wasn ' even tearing on a seam ( so there was no way to repair it ) . if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner it would most likely work .... it is not for a wedding with dancing !"
__label__-1 "i loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets . however the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams . additionally at 5 ' 8 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it . however the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i 'd even worn it so i thought it would probably only get worse . too bad because it 's gorgeous and flattering !"
__label__-1 "usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one . i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top . possibly better on smaller chests . the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good . not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs . going back : ("

__label__-1 "i was struggling with the options above -- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large ? it is both too small and too large which is really strange . the model makes this shirt look stunning but the product is actually very boxy . i am 5 ' 3 weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs . i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy . quite frankly it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money"
__label__1 "it is beautiful but not practical for me - the student who carries a backpack ! i did n't notice it does n't have sleeves it is regular poncho soft and stylish . recommended for poncho lovers !"
__label__-1 "i totally agree with the last reviewer . i 'm 5 ' 2 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders . the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i could n't move my arms . the small was better but was too big in the torso . the material itself was really nice . too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering ."
__label__-1 "this jacket looked adorable on . it was also quite comfortable . however it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched . sadly this is a deal breaker for me ."
__label__1 "great top ! a little large but i shrank it a little in the wash and it fits a little better now . i love the structure and pattern of this top as well as the lovely coral/orange color . it can be dressed up or dressed down ! love it !"
__label__0 "the cut and print of this dress is beautiful . however the armhole is way too low which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days . please do n't drop the armholes so low most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm !"
__label__1 "i ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did . it 's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect . i like the length of the shirt ."
__label__1 "love these ! loose and comfy everywhere . delighted to have found a 32 and delighted that they are roomy even at the waist . i exchanged another pair of pilcro 's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict but as usual retailer customer service was excellent . earlier sale price was honored easy returns in the orignal shipping bag .. retailer design fashion and company attitude excels !"
__label__-1 "i bought this outfit online on sale - so i only paid $ 70 but i think if i saw it in person first i probably would n't have purchased it . while the design is cute the fabric is beyond cheap . it 's not just polyester - it 's like a plastic polyester . i think if you dress it up with high heels necklace armful of bangles you can probably distract from the fabric . 5 ' 5 120lb purchased xs and it 's a little big still ."
__label__-1 "i have had this shirt for a little over a month . i 've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder . it 's not even on a seam so i ca n't fix it . i expect much better quality from retailer . do n't buy this . the quality is very disappointing . which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts ."

__label__0 "so despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways . the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect . the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it 's right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show . it 's unfortunate because this dress is adorable . it would fit tts except length . unfortunately this one has to go back ."
__label__-1 "this blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and ca n't be saved . the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just does n't lay right underneath . the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse . i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print . definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25- % ."
__label__-1 "i thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on . it got stuck at my hips . i 'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts . i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible . its going back . now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me ! wish i had read them before purchasing . retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one ."

__label__0 "such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful . the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist . it is however not made for the busty gal . i am a 32 dd the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest . also this dress is short waisted it is almost an empire on me . i wish it worked as it is lovely . perhaps it will work on the someone super thin ? so sad about it !"
__label__-1 "loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding . unfortunately the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else . it fit well but was poorly made . based off other reviews this is n't the first time this has happened with this dress ! not worth the risk at all ."
__label__1 "i usually wear a medium and this jacket was no exception . the jacket is a shorter style as pictured . it is still flattering even though it is a little boxy . i got the grey which is a dark gray/slight greige color . if you like edgier over boho this is a cute transitional jacket ."
__label__0 "color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on . i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine . now for the cons : it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock under my arm which could be seen i guess if i waved . the rest were parts of the bird . i would love to have the one in the photos ! next who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea ? if i had gotten a nice patterned top i would have replaced the buttons . blouses that i like never seem to b"
__label__-1 "on a positive note the dress was very well made great quality as usual from retailer . however . this dress looked like a sack i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape . very plain and unflattering . for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ... so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me . it had to go back ."
__label__-1 "this is a beautiful dress . however it looked awful on me . i ordered the medium and it was huge . also i looked 7 months pregnant . not a good style for the short person ."
__label__1 "fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate . took my usual size four i am moderately short waisted ."
__label__-1 "why is it so difficult to find a shirt that does n't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm ? this is cute ( beyond the arm hole issue ) but overpriced . going back ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this sweater . the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms . i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions . i can see it in the picture but did n't notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater . slight design flaw ."
__label__0 "i love this dress i mean it si really pretty in person however the breast area is just too small ... i ca n't wear a bra with it and my older breasts just droop not flattering . they are barely covered ... i am a bit disappointed at that but if you are smaller up there i say give it a try ... i am 115 lbs 26.5 ion waist 30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest . colors and fabric are great i love that the different colors are different types of fabric ... too bad ."
__label__0 "i love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish : ( really sad because the material is gorgeous ! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine . i 'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women . the only complaint is have is that the straps seem delicate . the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though !"
__label__0 "the regular length i tried on in store definitely did n't work for me . for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are 38-30-40 ."
__label__1 "the front and back materials differ . the back of the shirt is soft and thin . the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though ."
__label__-1 "this dress is super bulky and unflattering . the knit is loose and see-through . looks like it was knitted by a five-year old . if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you . back to the store it goes"
__label__1 "got this in medium ( 5 ' 6 ' 36c 120 lbs. ) . many of retailer tops i 'm a small but this was a good fit for the m. got the white . not really see through but need to cut the side tag out as it shows through . i 'm not sure about the other reviews - this was totally not boxy on me - falls very nicely and drapes slightly . a really sweet but simple tee shirt to wear in the summer . you can wear this dressed up with heels stacked sandals or just with flats - ballet or strappy sandals . looks great with rolled"
__label__-1 "purchased this in two colors online . purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs . the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering . returning both ."
__label__-1 "i sized down as other reviewers suggested ( usually an 8 went down to 6 ) and the dress fit fine -- but it was not attractive . the cut was like a tent with an empire waist . really just not attractive . maybe it has to do with my body type but compared to the model this dress was so unflattering in-person . returned ."
__label__-1 "i do n't know who this would fit . looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress . . . but just looked like a sack ! i think the knit must have stretched into an unnatural shape - especially the arms !"
__label__-1 "the skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red . the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me . the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return ."
__label__0 "too floppy ; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure ."
__label__1 "the embroidery is breathtaking . it is more flattering and interesting in person . i would highly recommend it ! . it is true to size figure flattering and unique . the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy . if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece this is it !"
__label__0 "the top was very nice and i liked the material . my problem was getting it on with the cami being attached to the top . it took me a while to figure it out . and for that reason alone i returned it ."
__label__1 "they fit me great are super comfortable . they are casual yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs . they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions . i love them with booties : ) . i think they look better in person than online too"
__label__1 "these are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings . i am 5 ' 8 tall and 127lbs . i bought a s/m . they very soft and warm . they stay up perfectly and do not pinch or make any lines . i am amazed that they are so inexpensive . i am buying 2 more after this review !"
__label__1 "i love this jess . i got it in the blue gray color and i think it 's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well . cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft . i 'm thinking that i 'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well"
__label__0 "i had high hopes for this coat but it was a miss for me . while the wool is soft and not itchy the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy . also the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located . i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was but alas i just could not get over the poor tailoring . for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs ) and it was big ."
__label__1 "i have an athletic body 5 ' 6 . i have no curves and this dress made me look so feminine and long and lean . on top of it being beautiful the dress has a very comfortable jersey knit type lining . so easy to wear and incredibly comfortable sitting and /or dancing ."
__label__-1 "remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties ? ! that 's exactly what this sweater is . everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere . i 'll pass on this !"
__label__1 "i received many compliments on this dress . for a maeve dress it did run large . i normally take a 4 or 6 in maeve but with this dress i bought the size 2 and it fits perfect . i am 5 ' 2 and 120 lbs . i have a little belly and this dress hides it well . beautiful colors and nice shape . it also hits at my knee so it is perfect for work ."
__label__-1 "so disappointed ! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange . loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs ."
__label__-1 "saw this online and went in to try on . fit great and is true to size but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread . i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps . well literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam"
__label__1 "love this t-shirt . the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer . it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps ."
__label__0 "love the top . love the color . love the back detail . as a larger chested woman the shape was lost a bit . but i just could n't resist ."
__label__1 "i have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout . it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall . the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top . i am pleased with my purchase !"
__label__0 "i do n't know why this piece is so wide around the body . the fabric is very good . just the design is way boxy . i get xsp still boxy ."
__label__0 "this is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy . i have sensitive skin and had to return it because of this . otherwise it would have been a keeper ."
__label__-1 "the cut of the top portion of the dress is off . i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area . i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up . for reference i am a 34b . i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it was n't for said flaw ."
__label__0 "definitely pj quality . i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent . and it 's very thin so it works as a swim cover but definitely not a dress for anything else ."
__label__1 "dress is darling and well made . however it runs very large . i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp . would be great for taller slim women . the style is so cute . the online picture does not do it justice ."
__label__1 "i tried on the xs in store in crimson ( i would need petite ) - the color and fit were very flattering on me ( pale skin ) . the dress feels very silky i love the back how it ties and how high the neckline was on me in the front . the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch . my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee ... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work ... reference : 115 lbs 30dd 26.5 in waist ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite . it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything . it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me . it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just did n't lay down well bunching out on the sides in a way i did n't find to be very flattering . so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm but 3 stars for actual fit on . alas it is going"
__label__0 "another shirt i really wanted to love . i adore green but so few tops are made in this color . ( please make more ! ! ) however this shirt did n't work for me . i think it 's a matter of where your curves live . the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery . sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on . probably a great shirt for different body types . would love to see more green clothing ...."
__label__0 "really liked this dress but it ran too big for me ."
__label__-1 "i was surprised by the other reviews . expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward . the hi-low cut with so much bulk just was n't flattering . i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body . the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more . it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i 'd hoped . it went back ."
__label__0 "super soft super cute but too short for a dress too long and too overwhelming for a shirt and did n't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i 'm returning . love the colors feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional ... having said that .. fits tts i guess ."
__label__0 "very soft material length is great a little more loose than i would have liked ."
__label__1 "i bought this in the pattern in a size medium . i am a size 4-6 ( 38 around the hips/butt ) . the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves . the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and did n't outline every curve of my butt . the material is very soft and comfortable but it did n't feel thin or cheap or see-through . it has a nice weight to it . i am tall ( almost 5 ' 9 ) and it fit me just as it appears in the picture ."
__label__0 "this top is very light and soft for summer . even the lace is soft . it 's not sheer and does n't require layering . true to size . i 'm 5 ' 4 34dd 150 lbs- m fits well . my arms are not tiny and yet the lace were n't tight for me . but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer . it 's good if you are paying the sale price ."
__label__1 "great arm coverage soft material flattering fit . wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts . i really should purchase another color for summer work staple ."
__label__0 "i did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer . i can see it now in the photo but i just thought it was n't part of the actual vest . when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design . i do n't know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it . in my opinion the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest . i guess i could have spent some time and removed it but at that price i just sent it back . too bad because the m"
__label__-1 "the concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice . the inner layer is sheer but as long as you 're wearing a nude-colored bra no big deal . however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy . they must 've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top because it looks like it hangs straight on her . i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package it clearly flares out & is a-line . so as a previous reviewer stated it looks huge from the front . if it had fit the"
__label__0 "i really liked the style of this top but it 's way oversized ! i 'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs . the material is nice but i ca n't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big . this one is going back to the store !"
__label__1 "love the cotton knit for the comfort but from a distance this blouse looks dressier . the embroidery adds a nice flare . personally i was happy that this is long enough to cover my bottom as it gives it a nice lean look with skinny jeans and pants . i found that it ran a little bit but choose to keep the size i ordered anyway ."
__label__0 "note : if you have a large chest the seams hit in an unflattering spot . nice shirt just not great for the price ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted this is a pretty top . i really love the design . alas however it is too big for my frame . for reference i am barely 5 ' 1 and about 105 lbs . i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me . it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place . the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits . i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp . i am going to have to part with it sadly ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight . however it is an awkward length . i am tall and have a long torso so it 's just not cut right for me and was not flattering ."
__label__0 "very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties . did n't lay well on chest for me . returned it ."
__label__1 "this sweater is very comfy and looks great with tighter leggins . beautiful color"
__label__1 "this vest is a stunner ! the dark brown suede is so beautiful . the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest . it 's hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch . yes it is a little pricey but it 's an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too . it 's a keeper ! ! !"
__label__0 "the white is completely sheer . i am so tired of see through shirts ! ! even at the sale on top of sale prices i would n't recommend this shirt . if the fabric were n't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back . but it just looks silly with a tank top under it the cotton just does n't lay right ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with these online . i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim . unfortunately they did not work for me . i am 5 ' 2 and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts . it did n't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical . the denim itself is nice and heavy but like the previous reviewer stated not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes despite the wash discrepancy ."
__label__0 "i ca n't believe how small these are . i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly . these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them . the rise in the crotch is also very short . very full in the legs and one is longer than the other : ( the stripes do n't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price !"
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this top . love the mix of fabrics and patterns . but it is too short for a tunic length . i should have paid attention to other reviews . i 'm about 5 ' 8 '' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length is n't right ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail . the floral design is nice but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt ( especially considering the price ) . most disappointingly the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes . with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and thus could not even put the shirt on . needless to say i will be returning it . i ordered the xs so it is possible that larger sizes do n"
__label__-1 "i love the colors . however $ 200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric no lining what so ever . the fabric is very thin . you will need a slip . looks just like a cover-up . going back ."
__label__0 "it really is such a cute romper . took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable . that is in till i washed it . i 'm in europe so there are n't dryers ... washed it in cold water line-dried it and it shrunk . significantly . it still fits but the top does n't blouse over like it previously did . and the shorts feel really short . so disappointed . my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water"

__label__-1 "the material is so thin and so itchy .. like other reviewers stated .. it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper .. i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy . otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots"
__label__1 "love this top . the beautiful and delicate details are wonderful . the cut is a loose fit which is great . it works with tailored trousers and jeans"
__label__0 "while there is nothing wrong with this top it did n't really have an retailer feel . it looked more like something from a dept store maybe a boutique . i got on sale but sending back bc i just do n't like it that much especially next to my pale skin . i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone . i 'm usually a 8/10 med . small in this top fit well ."
__label__1 "i love this top soooooo much ! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness . i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top . it is comfortable even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms . i love that the colors are not bold i am sick of neon ! ! ! !"
__label__0 "pretty top i like the flutter sleeve design . the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white . nice for the sale price . can easily be dressed up or down ."
__label__0 "i looked like i was going to work on a farm . well made but seemed fit big . i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris these were cartoonishly wide . needless to say they were returned ."
__label__1 "these jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up . the material is soft and they fit perfect . they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise . the only problem is that they are really long . i am 5 ' 9 and they are too long for me which never happens . so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks . i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels ."
__label__1 "ca n't say about fit just yet since it is a gift ; color is soft green and versatile . finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt"

__label__-1 "at first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette . the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because in person the shirt fits like a circus tent . without exaggeration there is a surplus of about 16 inches . the material is still beautiful . and because of that i have n't decided whether i 'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner more fitted shape ."

__label__-1 "lovely colors and print . my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side ( it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely ! ) and worse the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread which showed through the sheer netting layer on top . for the price this particular detail should have been addressed ."
__label__1 "i ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color ! looks great with my blonde hair . the bell sleeves which are all the rage right now add to the feminine look . i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look !"
__label__-1 "i loved this skirt . so flattering and such a beautiful fabric . unfortunately after only 2 wears the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me ( literally ) . i bought the right size and it was not too tight . the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly . very disappointing ."

__label__-1 "do not buy ! i used my 15 % discount on this . what a waste . my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand . i should have gotten a small . i do n't think that would 've helped . it was so awkward looking . nothing like the model . it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds . it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet . the material was really thick . it is more appropriate for fall . i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down . it was just so ridiculous ."
__label__0 "i saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on . i was a bit disappointed . the size is tts but the prints were prettier online . the material is ok. the regular is long so probably wo n't look good on a shorter person if it is still available when the price comes down i might buy it ."
__label__1 "the embroidery on this was beautiful but did n't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body ."
__label__-1 "what a shame this dress is . i wear xl and am 5 ' 2 but the dress in the store in the size xs ( ! ! ! ! ! ) looked just the right size . yup ! xs was just the right size . i ca n't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering . it would look like a sack . it is an inch or two too short in the front for me so i 'll be returning it ."
__label__-1 "i bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding . first time wearing when i tied the strap the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress . i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up . if this is all that is holding the dress on it should be more secure with reinforced stitching . beautiful material and comfortable ."
__label__-1 "this sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off . it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it . it was uneven and stretched out . it looked like it was not well made to me . it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz . i returned this one ."
__label__-1 "visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat . and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed . i 'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized . i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy . especially around the collar . there is nothing crisp about it . i 've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this . if i wanted fleece i would n't have picked retailer as the s"
__label__-1 "good reason to read reviews . i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy . heavy fabric makes matters worse ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater . the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw . but it is lightweight and delicate . i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly . i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness i had to say no . i will watch for sale ."
__label__0 "so the dress is interesting . has an asymmetrical wrap look short sexy length ( i 'm 5 ' 3 and the petite barely covers my assets ) and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed but looks sexy and plunging . but the shoulders are what make it look matronly . they 're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm . they show no shoulder at all which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish . i looked back"
__label__1 "i was n't sure about this dress because some of retailer 's cloths can make a women appear older before her time . i have to say that is not the case with this dress . i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on . i 'm 5 ' 6 115lbs and it fit perfect . the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin . i wo n't even need sunless tanner . i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again ."
__label__1 "i love this top . of course i love most things that are denim or look like denim . this is a fun twist on a denim shirt the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching . i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it ! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional ."
__label__0 "i love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears -- very detailed . it is both subtle ( not cheap looking ) and special . as an earlier reviewer noted the top is not see-through a plus . the drawbacks though mean that i will be returning this top . 1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well . i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose even in that size and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives"
__label__0 "it seems like most people love this tee so you might as well . i returned it because i did n't like how the front hung . if the front was as long as the back i would have kept it . or if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants untucked i might have kept it ( seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts ) . i do like the material though . it 's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area . and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it"

__label__0 "a pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while . had to return it ."
__label__1 "i just love this dress ! it is so pretty and feminine and comfortable . the colors and patterns are perfect for both spring and fall and i know that this is one piece that i will get a lot of use out of . originally i thought the cut would be a bit boxy but it is not at all . in fact the fabric is beautiful soft and flowy with a lovely bohemian aesthetic . it looks great with tights tall boots and a big floppy wool hat . any one considering this dress should defiantly try it on as it is highly u"
__label__0 "this romper is extremely well made and the colors are even more beautiful in person . however i found it to run extremely short in the torso . i could n't get my arms through the sleeves after stepping into it without ripping the garment . for reference i 'm 5 ' 9 with a slightly longer than average torso . i ordered my normal size m ."
__label__1 "saw this top online and hoped for the best . my hopes were rewarded ! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also . i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper . have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments ."
__label__1 "this sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up but it 's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable warm and wintry at the same time . it does run true to size i ordered a small ( 5 ' 5 and 118 lbs ) . knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season ! ! !"
__label__1 "love the design ! fabric is very light and flowy . i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage . runs a little wide . size down . such a fun top i 've had tons of compliments ! i usually wear a size 8 and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small ."
__label__0 "if you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you . i wanted to love it because of the material and i 've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight . this just looked awful on me . maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut ."
__label__1 "most of my jeans are ag . love the ankle length and wash on these . not too distressed either . tts . really soft denim ! size 27 like my other ag 's"
__label__0 "i 'm all over this trend but this vest is quite thick/poufy and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball . i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best . on me a sweater vest would perhaps be better . i am chesty . but i cant decide . its really cute ! if you 're taller than 5 ' 4 do n't hesitate ."
__label__-1 "this is a rare review for me i usually love my retailer purchases even at times when other reviewers are n't fans but this top is terrible . 5 ' 4 103 32 b for reference small frame athletic bought the xs in black . the length could have been longer but i could have lived with the length . the arm hole area however a different story . because it 's boxy and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape it did not fit snuggly"
__label__0 "this is a pretty adorable jumper . the size 8 would fit someone really well who 's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5 ' 6 . i 'm 5 ' 9 and it was too short . it 's fun and definitely different . i 'd otherwise wear it ."
__label__0 "i ordered my normal size in this dress . i am 6 foot tall but the regular sizes were too large and too long ( mid-calf ) . i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline . the dress is lovely especially on the models in the pictures but did n't quite work out for me . also it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time !"
__label__1 "i thought these were great everyday shirts for the price . i got them on sale over christmas . they fit well and i really love the striped shirt . the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless"
__label__1 "i found this today on the one and only rack . i absolutely fell in love with it . i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly . other customers were asking where they could find it in the store . i highly recommend . it can be dressed up or down ."
__label__0 "this silk skirt was not the best look for me but may work for others . i purchased the med which fit fine . i just was n't in love with the print/colors . the skirt has quality material and is well made . it 's very light and airy . i did return it ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it . but was disappointed when i received it . first was the color . i chose the green and it was n't what i thought . it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass . when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt . the color was that bad . the fit was the next problem . this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted . the top was loose and that added to the flowy"
__label__-1 "this dress is cuter is person than online but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open . it fell off the minute i tried to undo it . i ca n't believe these other reviewers did n't have the same problem . or maybe they put a snap there instead . too bad ."
__label__-1 "i was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer . this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms . it 's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me . i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it . it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure ( 5 ' 8 and athletic ) . i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu"
__label__0 "i so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating . it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo . it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses . i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room . in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves . one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns . the lower"

__label__1 "this sweater is very comfortable and soft . unlike other reviewer i did not find the lace to be itchy . i 'm 5 ' 4 usually size 6 ; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel . this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted . it 's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy . not sure how it 's going to handle the wash ."
__label__-1 "this product looks great on the model but for anyone with a normal body type the band in the center is way too tight . i 'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips . the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph it is truly lavender and purple . i really wanted to love this swimsuit but instead i had to return it pay for return shipping and i am out about $ 20 now . very disappointed ."
__label__0 "... the print is so sharking and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i 'm a more curvy figure and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering . ordinarily i love everything made by maeve but this one sadly must be returned ... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great ."
__label__0 "i was excited to receive in hopes to wear more as a tunic over skinnies vs a dress for fall . this runs sooo very large . the material is thick and the pattern is just ok. did n't do anything for my hourglass shape . returned ."
__label__-1 "i 'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress . the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange . for one thing the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse . i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag . also the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length . i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss"
__label__1 "i tried this top on with a pair of white shorts half tucked and it looked really classy and nice . the fit was loose but flattering it is a tiny bit sheer but i was wearing a magenta bra so perhaps i am biased . overall i think this is a good basic addition to a summer wardrobe can be worn with a nice skirt or with jeans as shown here . the 0 ( or xs ca n't remember ) fit me at 115 lbs with 30dd chest ."
__label__0 "i tried on the xs petite and liked it but did n't love . the arm holes seemed big you could see my pink bra peeked through on te sides . also the material is soft but thin ( see through somewhat ) . the xs petite just seemed big overall i would try the xxs petite if it goes on sale and is available . i am 115 lbs 30dd for reference ."
__label__-1 "the fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth ! the cut of this vest is also bad ! will be sent back !"
__label__0 "true to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso . very unflattering cut !"
__label__1 "i love this blouse with a pair of jeans . the neckline is fairly deep but very flattering and feminine . the detail is beautiful ."
__label__0 "i purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price . i ordered the 2 petite but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person . they are still very long ( to my ankles ) and the legs are very wide . the waist fits fine though ."
__label__0 "i 've been looking for some new casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color . i 'm a size 6 and the small fits great . i do n't find the blowzy style overwhelming . i am small boned but i 'm 5 ' 8 not a petite . i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ... a nice proportion . however i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame . i really like it however i see two drawbacks : the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily ( not good for travel ) . this"
__label__0 "i ordered this after seeing the rave reviews . it is not for me . just like the culottes i ordered this romper makes me feel like a grandma . i said i 'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again this was not for me . i also did n't like the back of the romper . no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it 's so low cut . the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric . tts also . i 'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this ."
__label__1 "comfortable flattering one step up in formality from jammies what more could you want ?"
__label__0 "like others reviewers mentioned on here this dress is extremely well made . but there were too many cons for me as well . this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame but for tall busty and curvier girls it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately . the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out . however i 'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top . there was entirel"

__label__1 "i tried this on at antho today and loved it ! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors . it is flattering in person . the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer but this is probably better anyway with spring coming ( it is coming right ? -today it 's snowing ) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it . it is versatile and could be paired with anything ."
__label__0 "i got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress . it was not well made at all ! the lining did n't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places . i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need ! the fabric itself is very nice but just not well made . i do not recommend this dress ."
__label__0 "this dress has great potential . i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off . as a previous review stated it 's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree the hem is also funky . i am still deciding if i want to keep it but if i do i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0 ."
__label__0 "i got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder like in one of the photos . my regular size ( medium ) was way too large so i went down to a small . however the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps . back it goes . if you 're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top you might like it . color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight ."
__label__-1 "this dress was adorable & fit great ! regrettably i had to return it since it was n't lined ."
__label__0 "this runs really big . i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out . i do n't have a store close by ( about an hour away ) and i hate paying shipping for returns ! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone . i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though !"
__label__0 "these leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants ; the rise is perfect . the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger ."
__label__0 "i loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail . as soon as i put it on though i was drowning in it . i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it . i still really like it and wish it would have worked . i am 5 ' 5 athletic/slim figure just for reference ."

__label__1 "i wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides . be creative and wear it different ways ."
__label__1 "really love this bathing suit . it fits very well definitely do n't need to size up for this one . flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days . excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer !"
__label__0 "i had reservations about this top based on other reviews but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances . i have an athletic build -- not model-thin but not dumpy either -- and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly . the sleeves were especially unflattering . i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs ."
__label__1 "great for layering and staying warm in the winter . definitely stay on the larger size the fabric has very little give but is comfortable ."

__label__0 "the high neck and square-ness did not work for me .. but might for someone else ."
__label__0 "this is a cute top but the fit is problematic . it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric . i got both an xsp and an xxsp . the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves . both are going back unfortunately . for reference i 'm 5 ' 103 lbs 32b ."

__label__1 "i thought i 'd be the first to review for non -size- small ladies ... i 'm usually between a large and xl in retailer . the large was great .. with room as this top is pictured . you 'll love the details on this colorful fun top ( ex : buttons on the side ) . great with skinnies . i bought it on sale but it really is a special top and worth the price ."
__label__1 "super soft and cute . the buttons add a nice touch . the color depicted online gave me pause but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic . great investment . beautiful sweater . 34c 65 135 and the small is perfect ."

__label__-1 "this blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great . i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest ! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions ! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side !"
__label__0 "i want to love this shirt but it is n't happening . the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting . the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great if the fit works for you ."

__label__-1 "this dress is not flattering . the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy . like the other reviewer said its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through . it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it did n't help regardless . the length is not accurate either . i would say it 's a pretty short dress ( mid thigh ) but that probably depends on the person . it also makes you look very horizontal . i was really excited about this dress but it 's getting r"

__label__1 "the label says 100 % linen but it 's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen . it 's not a scratchy linen at all . it 's a very very fine knit but the top is not sheer . i do not think you need a cami under it . i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown . it has a slight drape but it 's not really baggy at all . i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is . it 's a bit darker and has a silver essence also . i liked this so much i just bought another one in mauve ."
__label__1 "these pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy . the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants . there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well which i like ."

__label__1 "the saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top . it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color . i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges . it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it . the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra . it is a rather loose fit so if you prefer something more form fitting you might opt for a smaller size ."
